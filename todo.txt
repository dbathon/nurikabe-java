solver strategies:
* unreachable unknown cells -> black
* unknown cells having neighbours with different non-null FixedCells -> black
* impossible white?: if the cell was white, then no solution possible -> black
* expand: if a group (white or black) is not complete and there is only one cell where it could expand, then that cell must belong to the group
* 2x2 block with three black -> remaining is white
